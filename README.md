# Epilipsy-Detection-using-the-CNN

## Description

In this study, we have proposed a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural network (CNN) for the automatic detection of epilepsy seizures. The automated process might be convenient in the situations where a neurologist is unavailable and also help the neurologists in proper analysis of EEG signals and case diagnosis. We have used two publicly available EEG datasets, which were collected from the two African countries, Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria.
